# white-netkit
This is a multipurpose tool which can be used in networking and network hacking related scenarioes.
This toolkit is a collection of Python scripts that provide various network-related functionalities for network exploration, analysis, and security testing. It includes functionalities such as MAC address spoofing, Tor routing, ARP spoofing, deauthentication attacks, network device discovery, and HTTP sniffing. The toolkit makes use of popular Python libraries such as subprocess, os, time, scapy, socket, random, fcntl, and struct to perform these tasks.

The MAC address spoofing functionality allows you to change the MAC address of a network interface to any desired MAC address, providing anonymity and security in network communication. The Tor routing functionality allows you to route network connections through the Tor network for enhanced privacy and security. The ARP spoofing functionality allows you to perform ARP spoofing attacks, which can be used for various purposes such as intercepting network traffic or redirecting network connections. The deauthentication functionality allows you to send deauthentication packets to a target access point or client, effectively disconnecting them from the network. The network device discovery functionality allows you to discover connected devices in a network, including their IP and MAC addresses, and device names. The HTTP sniffing functionality allows you to capture and analyze HTTP packets in a network for further analysis or security testing purposes.

Overall, this toolkit provides a comprehensive set of network-related functionalities that can be used for network exploration, analysis, and security testing in various network scenarios. It is a valuable tool for network administrators, security researchers, and ethical hackers who need to perform network-related tasks in their day-to-day activities.
